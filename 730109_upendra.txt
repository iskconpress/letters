My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated Jan. 2, 1973, and I have noted the contents with great care. I am very sorry to hear that you must undergo one operation of surgery upon your hernia condition, that is preventing you from opening a center in Perth. Yes, I can appreciate that you have opened so many centers now, all over the world, so never mind if some others may have to go there in your place. You take good rest and become very healthy by the time that I shall come there in February. If I get the opportunity I shall also go to that Hare Krsna farm near Melbourne City, 80 miles, and if you prepare some place for me to stay.

Hoping this meets you in the best of health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
