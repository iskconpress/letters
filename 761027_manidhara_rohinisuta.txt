My dear Manidhara and Rohini Suta,

Please accept my blessings. I have received a Letter from Jayatirtha saying that you have distributed in one week 522 and 521 big books respectively. This is very wonderful. I thank you so much. __Ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham__ [[books:bg:4:11|(Bg. 4.11)]]. Krsna becomes more and more pleased by seeing the increment of book distribution. Devotional service is absolute but Krsna is especially pleased to see someone preaching His glories.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.
