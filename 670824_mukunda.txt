My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I have your note regarding the initiation of Mr. Prasad. I’m sending per separate post (airmail) the beads and bag. I have received $1 in this regard; but I think I asked to send $5. $1 does not cover the cost of post etc. His name will be Birchandra Das.

I am glad to learn that your S.F. center is progressing well; this is all due to the sincere effort of the boys and girls. Your progress is confirmed also by the letter of Hayagriva, who says that the center is better than N. Y.  So it is very delightful to me.

So far my health is concerned, I am improving a bit daily, and most probably it will be possible for me to return by the end of Oct. next. It may be that Kirtanananda will return sooner, as he is taking sannyas this Janmastami (Janmasthmi) Day. Any of our students who wish to learn more about the Goswami literatures will have the greatest facilities for living here at Vrindaban, free of boarding, lodging, and tuition. This has been offered by my god-brother Swami Bon Maharaj, at his Institute of Oriental Philosophy. I’ve got his official letter in this regard, and I shall be glad if some of the students volunteer to come to India and learn the Vaishnav philosophy of (ub) a recognized institution.

I’ve seen your postcard to Vinod Kumar. If he can get immigration visa, why not try the same immigration visa for me on the strength of my certificates (cirtificates) which you have already got. I’ve not heard anything (any think) from Janiki. Hope she is well. While coming here she requested that next time I shall return direct to S. F. Krishna willing, it may be so, because I am thinking of returning via Tokyo and Hawaii. The best thing immediately will be to open a branch either at L. A. or San Diego, because it is practically seen that warm climate keeps me a little better.

Whatever progress I am making, I think it is due to that. I am very glad you are doing your best to open a branch at L. A.

When I return to Delhi I shall enquire of the Gita (Gira) Press there, as you requested. If you have not done so, please send the monthly $10. Also send a few copies of the “Kirtan in the Park” circulars.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
