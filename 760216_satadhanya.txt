Mikajima Ohaza, Japan

My dear Satadhanya das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 6 February 1976 and have noted the contents. It is nice that you are continuing to distribute BTG. If karmi dress is favorable, then go on with karmi dress. We have to execute missionary activities; dress is not fundamental.

Try to renovate our own position. Rectify it with the blessings of Krishna. Trivikrama Swami is well expert in Japanese dealings.

Yes, your idea is correct. The Japanese boys should join our movement.

Gurukrpa Swami has arrived here this morning and if he is not needed there I can send him to Bengala Desh.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
