My dear Krsnakanti,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your note dated April 18, 1972 and I have noted the contents. Thank you very much for your contribution of $20. Your endeavors to spread Krishna consciousness by means of radio and television is very encouraging to me, and I am looking forward to participating in this program when I return to Los Angeles soon.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
