My dear Sri Ghosh,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated 22nd inst. and have noted the contents. You are welcome to come and visit us here. By 8th October '76 I will be going out of station, so you may come before then.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
