Dear Sri Pillai,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your kind appreciation of my humble preaching activities. Please continue to read Bhagavad-gita As It Is. You will derive all spiritual benefit from it. Also if you can find the time, I will request you to visit our Temple in Juhu, Hare Krishna Land.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
