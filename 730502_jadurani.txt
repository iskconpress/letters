My dear Jadurani:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 25, 1973. Regarding the drawing for the TLC, you can do it in the same lines as it was done previously. Your drawing for the room of Sanatana Goswami is approved by me. Also approved by me is the sketch by Pariksit Das. Now you can go on making the pictures more and more beautiful and by so doing go back home, back to Godhead.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
