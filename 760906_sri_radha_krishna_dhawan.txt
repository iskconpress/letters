Dear Sri Dhawan,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated August 20, 1976 and have noted the contents.

The Hyderabad temple has been completed on Janmastami August 18, and the temple is called the Sri Sri Radha Madana Mohana Mandir. You can come and see me here in Vrndavana if you like, or perhaps we will come to Chandigarh by the first week in October for programs there.

Thank you very much for your nice letter. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
