My dear Mr. Asnani:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 17, 1974 and have noted the contents. I have today informed my centers at New York and Dallas to receive Mr. & Mrs. Malkani and arrange for their accommodation.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
