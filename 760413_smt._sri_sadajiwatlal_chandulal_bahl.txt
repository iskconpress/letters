My dear Smt. and Sri Sadajiwatlal Chandulal Bahl,

Please accept my blessings to you and your family. I received your kind invitation to attend your daughter's wedding and I thank you. As you know we are constructing the Hare Krishna Land project in Juhu Beach and we trust that you and your family members will take advantage of the facilities for generations to come.

I hope that this meets you in good health.*

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
