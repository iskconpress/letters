Dear Mr. Shastri,

Please accept my best wishes. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated Aug 3rd 1974. I am sorry for any misunderstanding. You are welcome to visit any of centers as a life member and enjoy all the facilities. The tour around the world has been called off, however you cannot expect for us to pay all transportation costs. When you go to Europe or America you be sure to visit our temples and they will receive you nicely and that you use the facilities there.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
