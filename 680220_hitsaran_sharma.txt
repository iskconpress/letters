My dear Hit Sharanji,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated Feb. 13, 1968, and I am so (go) glad that you have already taken up my printing work for Srimad Bhagwatam. It is very nicely set up; the choice of the type is also nice, but you have to be more careful about the proof-reading. You will find so many mistakes in the printed proof as I have indicated with marks. This work will go on continuously for some years, so you have to arrange for proof-reading more carefully. The American readers are very much sensitive if they find printing mistakes in a book, they are very badly impressed, and especially they are not reviewed in the public papers. Regarding the paper, I think it should be little thicker. I am sending herewith a specimen of paper which we are going to use in the printing of the Teachings of Lord Chaitanya, in Japan. I think the same quality of paper may be used in printing Srimad Bhagwatam.

I see there are different kinds of spelling in “Krishna”, as marked on page 1198. With diacritic signs, Krishna is spelled “Krsna<span class="s2">”</span>, but without diacritic signs, Krishna is spelled as “Krishna”. One of my students is preparing the diacritic signs on the Sanskrit verses; and I think you will have to collect some type with diacritic signs. Anyway, the printing mistakes must be avoided. I approve of the type, I approve of the print, the paper is also not bad, but thicker paper will be preferred; but you please arrange for correct proof-reading. Because, formerly, although you said that you would personally see to the proof-reading, I think on account of your being busy in so many ways, it won’t be possible to pay attention in this regard. But this is very important.

I have written one letter to Sri Syt. Jaidayal Dalmiaji yesterday, requesting him to be the President of our ISKCON branch in India. I hope you will read the letter and do the needful. I mentioned therein also the publication of the monthly magazine named “Krishna Consciousness,” as he has assured you to think over the matter. I hope he will accept the Presidency of the Indian branch. Here in the States, we have got different Presidents in different branches; I am the principle director of the institution, but the management is done independently by the President, Secretary and Treasurer in each branch. So, for our India branch also, we will have to organize in that way. I am expecting your next letter with details of the Indian branch. I have offered your good wishes to all my students here, and they are so pleased to have your good wishes. In our New York center, I have already advised the Secretary to send you all paper cuttings and propaganda, and I am going to advise all other Secretaries as advised by you.

In conclusion, I beg to request once more to arrange for the printing without any mistakes, and expedite the printing work as speedily as possible. Please let me know the reaction of Dalmiaji on my letter sent yesterday. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
