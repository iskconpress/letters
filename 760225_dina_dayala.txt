Athens

My dear Dina Dayala das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 6, 1976.

It is nice to hear that your activities are going on successfully in Athens. Caitanya Mahaprabhu says, prithivite ache yata nagar adi gram sarvasa . . . so now it is actually becoming a fact. This movement is being spread everywhere. Maintain your activities and increase gradually. I have instructed everything in my books. You may translate the Bhagavad-gita first.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
