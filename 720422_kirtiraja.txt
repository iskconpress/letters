My dear Kirtiraja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter, undated, along with your offering of $100, delivered to me here by Sriman Karandhara, and I thank you very much.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
