My dear Niranjana dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 6, 1975 and have noted the contents. Go ahead and continue your work and try to work co-operatively with Yasomatinandana dasa. Concerning a temple in Gorakhpur, Ramananda can consult with me about that.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
