My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your leter dated May 14, 1973. I have noted the contents.

Upon your recommendation I am happy to accept Giridhari das and his wife for second initiation. Please find enclosed one thread duly chanted on by Me and two gayatri mantra sheets. Now hold a fire yajna for devotees only and afterwards in private play the tape of me reciting gayatri mantra. Show them how to count on the finger divisions.

As you have rightly judged, there is nothing to worry about because I am completely protected by Krsna. So I have decided to remain here as Karandar is arranging for my physician to come here instead. Krsna can give real protection but a physician can only give so-called protection.

Thank you very much. Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
