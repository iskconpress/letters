My dear Citsukhananda das,

Please accept my blessings. The proposed farm project in nothern California is approved by me. Such projects as well as constructing temples, protecting cows, gathering milk, then making ghee, then opening Hare Krishna Restaurants are all good programs for grhasthas.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
