My dear Saptaratha das:

Please accept my blessings. I have seen a photo of the dolls you have made of Krishna lifting Govardhana Hill and also Balarama. Your son has sent the photo. So you have done it very nicely. Go on with this work.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami\\
