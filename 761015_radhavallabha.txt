My dear Radhavallabha Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated October 5th 1976.

Geetar-gan [Bengali] may be added in the front piece as you have suggested, spelling as above with Bengali in brackets.

There is no need to print Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, His Life and Precepts, it is already there in other books.

Ādi-Lila may be printed in 4 volumes as suggested by you.

Let me finish 9th canto then I shall decide, most probably I shall start 11th canto, but as yet I have not decided.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
