My dear Yasodananda Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of the Hare Krishna Souvenir printed from the Madras Centre. It appears that you neglected to advertise my books. It was a very good opportunity but why was it overlooked?

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
