My dear Svarupa dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated September 27, 1975, and I have noted the contents carefully. Your program of life-membership is a good idea. Thank you very much.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
