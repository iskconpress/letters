My dear Ādi Kesava and Dhrstadyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 9, 1976.

Upon your recommendation I will be pleased to accept Drsya Krsna, Hamsarupa, and Subuddhi Raya for second initiation. Now hold a fire sacrifice for devotees only. Let the initiates hear the tape of me chanting Gayatri in the right ear. Teach them how to chant on the finger divisions.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
