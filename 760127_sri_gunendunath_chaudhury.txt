Sri Gunendunath Chaudhury\\
Calcutta

Dear Sri Chaudhuryji,

I am in due receipt of your Bengali letter and I request you to come here to Mayapur. Live with us for some time, see the situation and conduct of your living with us, and then we shall decide what to do next.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
