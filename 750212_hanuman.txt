My dear Hanuman das

Please accept my blessings. Regarding your engagement, I strongly recommend and encourage you to travel extensively and preach our philosophy everywhere you go. You have my authorization to open centers as you see fit after considering twice and thrice. Do not whimsically open or establish any center and then close it down later on. Please report to me directly as to your whereabouts and your programs for preaching work. You must be very strict to follow all of the rules and regulations that I have given without even the slightest deviation. By a perfect example from your own conduct, others will be nicely trained up to be perfect Vaisnavas.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
