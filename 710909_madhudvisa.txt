My dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. Enclosed please find a copy of my letter to Dr. Bali regarding the program in Madras. There is no need of you going there immediately to see that house in Madras.

Tomorrow evening I am going to Kenya, the address is given above. After Mombassa you will be glad to know that I shall be returning to Bombay, which should be by the end of September.\\
Please offer my blessings to the others. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
