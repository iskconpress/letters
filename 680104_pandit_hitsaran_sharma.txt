My dear Hitsaranji,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter of December 27, 1967, and your kind reception to Sriman Achyutananda. I am so glad to learn that you have accepted Sriman Achyutananda as your younger brother, and this boy is very sincere devotee. I expect many more good results from this boy.

Herewith please find a cheque no. 0055450 for 2000.00 rs. which please credit on paper account. Please begin composing immediately in the same style as it is my first volume which you have got with you. The types should all be new founded and such types may be kept apart for printing my books only and as soon as they are old, must be changed into new again.

This is the beginning of printing of my books and it will continue till my death. Please arrange printing and composing nicely as it is suitable for the foreign taste and make your Radha Press known all over the world. The combination is nice and let us now execute the function nicely. The Press is Radharani and the printing is glories of Krishna. And the worker is a great learned devotee Pandit Hitsaran Sharma and I am Lord Krishna’s eternal servant.

The manuscript sent to you contains the full Second Canto and a few chapters of Third Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam.

I have finished the First Canto in three (3) volumes ending on page 1196. So the fourth volume should begin from page 1197, and be finished when it is 1600 page. Then the fifth volume should begin from page 1601 and be finished on page 2000. So please do it immediately. After these two volumes are finished we shall begin the sixth volume from page 2001 and so on till we finish the whole Bhagwatam, probably in sixty volumes.

Please give me a chance to finish this long project. There will be no scarcity of money. As soon as you want payment you get it. You simply print and send it to U. S. A.

----

In exchange of the books supplied if you want printing materials like machines, etc., I am sure you will get import license. And I will send you from here things as you need them. Let us cooperate fully in the service of Lord Krishna.

I am glad to know that you have moved to your new buildings and (and) hope everything (everthing) is happy now. I hope Srimati Bahuji is now doing well and so also your blessed son. Kindly reply my letters promptly and oblige. Hope you are well and thanking you once more.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
