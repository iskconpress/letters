Dear Krpasindhu,

Please accept my blessings. Thank you for your report of activities in the Regina, Canada temple and your presentation of pictures of Radha and Krsna Deity which are very attractive. I hope you are becoming more enthusiastic by your stay in Mayapur and when you return to Canada you will go on increasingly in your preaching work.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
