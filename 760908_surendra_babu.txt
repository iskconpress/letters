My dear Surendra Babu,

Please accept my blessings. On my return from Europe and America I have received your Vyasa Puja greetings and I thank you very much for the sentiments you have expressed therein. I am presently in Vrndavana and I am expecting to come to Mayapur as soon as possible, latest in December 1976 where I shall be very glad to meet you.

Thanking you,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
