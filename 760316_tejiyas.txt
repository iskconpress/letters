My dear Tejyas,

Please accept my blessings. I am enclosing one copy of a letter to the Punjab National Bank, Bengali Market, New Delhi. Kindly attend to this immediately. We can discuss further when I come to Delhi on the 24th March.

Hoping that this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
